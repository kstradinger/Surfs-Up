This is an analysis of weather in Hawaii to try and plan a great vacation.  Data is brought into a jupyter notebook using SQLite and then analyzed and visualized, using Pandas and MatPlotLib. The temperature is always lovely, of course, and the best time to avoid the percipitation is in the winter.
